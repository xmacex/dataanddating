# Data and Dating

Data and Dating, aka "Dat[a]ing" project from [#DMI17 summer
school](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/SummerSchool2017), looking
at data flows in dating and dating apps.

Most of our data and work, including analysis, primary data,
classification etc is elsewhere. This is mostly about
transforming data from a device that extracts Android app metadata,
including permissions, from Google Play, and our workflows.

In addition there are a few sketch propositions for company hierarchy
visualizations, automated WHOIS resolving etc. here.
